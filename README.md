This repository houses the lab and exercises carried out for the class Graphics Engineering.
The source code uses OpenGL 2.2 and much of the code is deprecated with more recent OpenGL versions.
This repository should be used for learning and teaching purposes only. 

Much of the code is not documented. 

The lab assignments include:
- Reading from a .ply and generating the object
- Creating a rotational object
- Creating a hierarchical object. (In this lab I created the robot Wall-e) :satisfied:
- Working with lighting and textures
- Adding interaction to a scene
